## Statistical Validation and Pipeline Development for Neuropsychiatric Genomics

My research focuses on the statistical validation of genetic variants associated with neuropsychiatric disorders and the development of standardized computational pipelines for genomic data analysis. I work at the intersection of neuroscience, computational genomics, and bioinformatics to advance our understanding of the genetic mechanisms underlying psychiatric conditions.

### Current Projects

#### Statistical Validation of GWAS-Identified Neuropsychiatric Variants

I'm investigating the statistical validity of genetic variants identified in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for neuropsychiatric disorders, particularly bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. My work involves integrating GWAS data with Massively Parallel Reporter Assay (MPRA) datasets and Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) data to validate genetic mechanisms contributing to disease risk.

A key finding from my research has been demonstrating the statistical failure of commonly used algorithms to prioritize causal variants - a significant contribution that challenges current methodological approaches in the field.

#### MPRA Data Analysis Pipeline Development

I'm developing standardized computational pipelines for analyzing MPRA data across five internationally funded centers as part of the International Impact of Genomic Variation on Function (IGVF) Consortium. This collaborative effort aims to create reproducible, systematic approaches to functional genomics analysis that can be implemented across different research institutions.

My role involves:
- Leading cross-center meetings to coordinate pipeline development
- Organizing teams to develop discrete pipeline components  
- Ensuring reproducibility and standardization across diverse computational environments

### Methodological Approach

My research integrates multiple computational approaches:

1. **Statistical Genetics**: Identifying genetic variants associated with neuropsychiatric traits
2. **Functional Genomics**: Characterizing the regulatory impact of genetic variation
3. **Transcriptomics**: Analyzing gene expression patterns in different brain cell types
4. **Machine Learning**: Developing predictive models for disease risk and progression

### Collaborative Projects

I collaborate with researchers across disciplines to enhance the impact of my work:

- **Psychiatric Genomics Consortium**: Contributing to large-scale genetic studies of psychiatric disorders
- **Neurodevelopmental Imaging Lab**: Connecting genetic variation to differences in brain structure and function
- **Computational Biology Group**: Developing new methods for analyzing multi-omic data
- **Bioethics Initiative**: Addressing ethical implications of genetic testing and research
