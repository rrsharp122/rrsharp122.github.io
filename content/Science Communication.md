## Other Science Communication Involvement

I'm actively involved in various science communication initiatives aimed at making complex neuroscience and genomics research accessible to diverse audiences:

- **Science Writing Workshops** - Conducting training sessions for fellow researchers on how to effectively communicate their findings to non-specialist audiences
- **Public Outreach Events** - Participating in community events to engage the public with current neuroscience research
- **Social Media Science Communication** - Creating accessible science content for social media platforms to reach broader audiences
- **Science Policy Communication** - Translating complex research findings into briefings for policy stakeholders
