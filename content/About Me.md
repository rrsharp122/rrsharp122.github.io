I am a science writer and Neuroscience PhD candidate passionate about the intersection of science and society. Guided by a belief in deeply collaborative and community-driven research, I love writing about topics in neuroscience, genetics, and social issues in accessible ways that highlight the social impacts and influences on research. 

### What brought me here?

{{< figure src="/images/rachel-chili.jpg" alt="Rachel..." class="float-left" width="300px" >}}

I could write about blending writing and science

Or I could write about bringing science to people in a way they can understand it 


Now, I study how social factors impact the genetic risk for bipolar disorder using large-scale genetic datasets.


### Beyond the lab

When I'm not writing or working on my thesis project, you can find me at the climbing gym, reading (check out *Until the Red Swallows It All* by Mason Parker), gardening, attending community activism events, or taking my cat, Taz, to a bar.
