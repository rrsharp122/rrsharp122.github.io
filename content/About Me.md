{{< figure src="/images/rachel-chili.jpg" alt="A photo showing Rachel posing next to another girl with long black hair. They are both flexing one arm like Rosie the Riveter, and you can see temporary tattoos of chilis on their biceps and cheeks. They are standing under a colorful gold, green, and red banner, in an atrium, that reads chili cookoff!" class="float-left" width="210px" >}}

I am a science writer and Neuroscience PhD candidate passionate about the intersection of science and society. Guided by a belief in deeply collaborative and community-driven research, I love writing about topics in neuroscience, genetics, and social issues in accessible ways that highlight the social impacts and influences on research. 

### Beyond the lab

{{< figure src="/images/rachel-organizingMarch.jpg" alt="A photo showing Rachel in action in the middle of a field. You can see a line of protestors with signs behind her. Rachel is holding a megaphone and seems to be yelling into it. She is wearing a backback, army green jacket, and lilac baseball cap. She looks super cool." class="float-right" width="210px" >}}

When I'm not writing or working on my thesis project, you can find me at the climbing gym, reading (check out *Until the Red Swallows It All* by Mason Parker), gardening, attending community activism events, or taking my cat, Taz, to a bar.
