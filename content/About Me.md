I am a science writer and Neuroscience PhD candidate passionate about the intersection of science and society. I believe in deeply collaborate and community-driven research, and love writing about topics in neuroscience, genetics, and social issues in...

### My Research Journey

I have always been torn between writing and science. In college, I chose to pursue research-oriented classes, but worked as a tutor in the writing center to keep writing in my life. It wasn't until graduate school that I realized I could write ABOUT science, and start combinging my passions. 

Now, I study how social factors impact the genetic risk for bipolar disorder using large-scale genetic datasets.


### Beyond the Lab

I'm passionate about communicating science in fun and engaging ways. I believe that science is for our communities, and I want to work to bring our communities closer to the science that we do for them. When I'm not analyzing data or reading papers, you might find me developing new ways to explain complex genomics concepts or working on science outreach projects.

I'm also deeply committed to making academia more inclusive and accessible. Having navigated graduate school myself, I understand the challenges that students face, particularly those from underrepresented backgrounds. I try to mentor and support other students whenever possible.
