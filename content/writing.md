## Writing Themes & Approach

My science writing focuses on:

- 🔍 **Translating complex research into accessible narratives**: Breaking down technical concepts without oversimplification
- 📖 **Highlighting the human stories behind scientific discoveries**: Connecting research to real-world impact
- 🌉 **Bridging academic research and public curiosity**: Making science relevant to everyday life
- 🧩 **Interdisciplinary connections**: Exploring how neuroscience intersects with ethics, society, and policy
- 🧠 **Neurodiversity and mental health**: Discussing the science behind neurological differences with respect and accuracy

### Writing Philosophy

I believe that effective science communication requires:

- **Accuracy**: Maintaining scientific integrity while simplifying concepts
- **Accessibility**: Creating multiple entry points for readers of different backgrounds
- **Engagement**: Using narrative techniques to make science compelling
- **Empathy**: Recognizing the human implications of scientific research
