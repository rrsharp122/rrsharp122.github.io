## WHAT UP!

ðŸŒ´ My name is Rachel Sharp (she/her), and I am a PhD candidate in Neuroscience & Computational Genomics at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

ðŸ§  Currently, I study the role of genetic variation in brain development and neuropsychiatric disorders in the Brain Genomics Lab.

ðŸŽ“ I am a proud alum of the University of Rochester, where I studied Neuroscience with a minor in Computational Biology.

ðŸ§ª During my undergraduate studies, I conducted research on the neural mechanisms of decision-making and worked on developing new analytical methods for neuroimaging data.

âœ¨ Although science is what I want to do for the rest of my career, I am extremely passionate about diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility in STEM (DEIA) and empowering the next generation of scientists.

ðŸŽµ Outside of lab, I am a HUGE fan of music. Here's what I've been listening to:
- The Kooks
- Cage the Elephant
- LCD Soundsystem
- Vampire Weekend

## Research Interests

My research sits at the intersection of neuroscience, genomics, and computational biology. I'm particularly interested in:

- Integrating multi-omic data to understand neuropsychiatric disorder mechanisms
- Developing computational methods to analyze large-scale genomic datasets
- Investigating the genetic architecture of neurodevelopmental disorders
- Translating scientific findings into clinical applications

## Current Projects

I'm currently working on several interdisciplinary projects that combine my interests in neuroscience, genomics, and computational biology:

### Multi-omic Integration in Psychiatric Genomics

This project aims to integrate genomic, transcriptomic, and epigenomic data to better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying psychiatric disorders. By combining these different data types, we can gain a more comprehensive view of the biological processes involved in these complex conditions.

### Computational Methods for Genomic Analysis

I'm developing new computational tools and workflows in R to analyze complex genomic datasets. These methods are designed to be robust, reproducible, and accessible to researchers without extensive programming experience.

### Science Communication Initiative

Beyond my bench research, I'm passionate about making complex scientific concepts accessible to broader audiences. I'm currently developing a series of explainer articles and visualizations that break down recent advances in neuroscience and genomics.
